# Data Bytes - Command Line Wizardry

While specialized software exists for data cleaning and analysis, you may not always have access to it, or you may have more files or data records than the software supports.

The Unix command line offers a universal tool that works on laptops, workstations, and high-performance-computers alike.

Take your command line skills to the next level! Learn commands for data cleaning that can run on millions of records in matter of seconds. Learn how you can combine commands into powerful workflows using pipes and how to apply those workflows automatically to many different files using loops.

## Pre-Class Instructions
If you would like to follow along during the session, make sure you have a terminal program installed.

### Mac
For Mac users, the `terminal` application, installed by default in MacOS, is the best way to follow along. For details on opening and using the application, follow this guide [opening the Terminal application on MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)

### Windows
For Windows users, the fastest way to get a working `terminal` application is to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). Git for Windows provides a terminal emulator called `Git BASH`. Use `Git BASH` to follow-along.

### Linux
For Linux users, you will have a working terminal emulator installed by default, although it will vary by Linux distribution.
