# Data Bytes - Command Line Wizardry

While specialized software exists for data cleaning and analysis, you may not always have access to it, or you may have more files or data records than the software supports.

The Unix command line offers a universal tool that works on laptops, workstations, and high-performance-computers alike.

Take your command line skills to the next level! Learn commands for data cleaning that can run on millions of records in matter of seconds. Learn how you can combine commands into powerful workflows using pipes and how to apply those workflows automatically to many different files using loops.
