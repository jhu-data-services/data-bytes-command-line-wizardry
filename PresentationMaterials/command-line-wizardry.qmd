## Before we begin

View the slides for today's session at: <br> [bit.ly/command-line-wiz-slides](https://bit.ly/command-line-wiz-slides)

. . .

If you would like to follow along, make sure you have a terminal emulator installed. For instructions on how to do so, visit the workshop page instructions: <br> [Pre-Class Instructions](https://jhu-data-services.github.io/data-bytes-command-line-wizardry/#pre-class-instructions)

##  {auto-animate="true"}

This session is not exhaustive.

It's meant to give you a brief introduction to the command line, and inspire you with some of the really powerful command line utilities, and convince you it's...

## Unix

::: {.column width="50%"}
When we are talking about the command line, we are really talking about the **Unix** command line.

**Unix** is a family of computer operating systems, originally developed in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.

## Why the **Unix** command line?

. . .

<br> **Unix is universal!**

. . .

<br> Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface, including standard specifications for command-line utilities.

. . .

<br> This standard is the **Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)** standard, and it's the reason why the command line works the same on almost all computers\*.

. . .

<br> \* Windows is the exception.

# `pwd`

**p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory

# `ls`

**l**i**s**t the contents of a directory

``` bash
ls
```

# `cd`

**c**hange **d**irectory

<br> `cd ~`<br>change directory to home

<br> `cd ..`<br>go up one directory, for example from `/home/username/Documents` to `/home/username`

# `curl`

**c**lient for **url**

. . .

<br> `-O` : Write output to a file named the same as the remote file

``` bash
curl -O https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
```

# `unzip`

open, or **un**-**zip** a .zip compressed file.

. . .

``` bash
unzip shell-lesson-data.zip
```

# `cat`

Con**cat**enate: join together and print the contents of one file, one after another

. . .

<br>

``` bash
cat cubane.pdb
```

# `wc`

**W**ord **c**ount: counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file

. . .

<br> `wc -l` : only print line count <br> `wc -w` : only print word count <br> `wc -c` : only print character count

# `*` wildcard

the `*` wildcard expands to all possible matches.

. . .

``` bash
wc -l *.pdb
```

# `>` Output Redirection

`>` sends the output of the previous command to a file

. . .

<br>

``` bash
wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
```

. . .

<br>

::: callout-warning
If you use `>` to send output to an existing file, it will be **overwritten**.

Use `>>` to append to the end of an existing file instead.
:::

# `head` and `tail`

`head` prints the first 10 lines of each file provided to it.

`tail` prints the last 10 lines of each file provided to it.

. . .

<br> `head -n 3`<br> Print the first 3 lines of a file <br>

. . .

<br>

``` bash
head -n 6 lengths.txt
```

# `sort`

`sort`the contents of a file alphanumerically.

. . .

<br> `sort -n`<br> Sort numerically

. . .

<br> `sort -nr`<br> Sort numerically in reverse order (descending)

. . .

``` bash
sort -nr lengths.txt
```

# `|` Pipe

The pipe `|` allows you to pass the results from one command to the next command.

. . .

You can string together simple commands to create much more powerful actions. <br>

. . .

``` bash
cat lengths.txt | head -n 6 | sort -nr
```

# `cut`

Slice and dice your text by position, character, or field.

. . .

<br> `cut -d, -f 1`<br> Retrieve the first column of a comma-delimited (csv) file

. . .

<br> `cut -d" " -f 3`<br> Retrieve the third column of a space-delimited file

# `less`

`less` reads in a text-file on page at a time.

`f` : go forward one page<br> `b` : go backward one page<br> `g` : go to beginning<br> `G` : go to end<br> `/` : search forward<br> `?` : search backward<br> `q` : quit less<br>

# `sed`

**s**tream **ed**itor, performs editing on a stream of text, line by line.

. . .

<br> `sed '10,100d'` deletes text in the range lines 10 to 100

. . .

<br>

``` bash
cat LittleWomen.txt | sed '20653,21022d' > little-women-no-footer.txt
```

<br>

. . .

``` bash
cat little-women-no-footer.txt | sed '0,93d' > little-women-no-footer-header.txt
```

. . .

# `sed`

**s**tream **ed**itor, performs editing on a stream of text.

<br>

`sed 's/apple/banana/g'` finds all occurrences of the word `apple`, and replaces it with `banana`

# `<` input redirection

Some utilities (like `tr`) take a stream of text, not a file. In these cases, we use the input redirection (`<`) to send a stream into `tr`.

# `tr`

`tr`ansliterate, or search and replace characters.

<br>

`[:punct:]` Match all punctuation <br> `[:lower:]` Match all lowercase characters <br> `[:upper:]` Match all uppercase characters <br> `[:space:]` Match all spaces <br>

. . .

<br>

``` bash
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < little-zombies.txt > little-zombies-lower.txt
```

<br>

. . .

``` bash
tr -d '[:punct:]\r' < little-zombies-lower.txt > little-zombies-clean.txt 
```

. . .

<br>

``` bash
 tr ' ' '\n' < little-zombies-clean.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > little-zombie-word-count.txt
```
