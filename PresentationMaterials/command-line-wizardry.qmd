## Unix

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
When we are talking about the command line, we are really talking about the **Unix** command line.

**Unix** is a family of computer operating systems, originally developed in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.

## Why the **Unix** command line?

. . .

<br> **Unix is universal!**

. . .

<br> Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface, including standard specifications for command-line utilities.

. . .

<br> This standard is the **Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)** standard, and it's the reason why the command line works the same on almost all computers\*.

. . .

<br> \* Windows is the exception.

# `pwd`

**p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory

# `ls`

**l**i**s**t the contents of a directory

```{.bash}
ls
```

# `cd`

**c**hange **d**irectory

<br> `cd ~`<br>change directory to home

<br> `cd ..`<br>go up one directory, for example from `/home/username/Documents` to `/home/username`

# `curl`

**c**lient for **url**

. . .

<br> `-O` : Write output to a file named the same as the remote file

```{.bash}
curl -O https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip
```

# `unzip`

open, or **un**-**zip** a .zip compressed file.

. . .

```{.bash}
unzip shell-lesson-data.zip
```

# `cat`

Con**cat**enate: join together and print the contents of files, one after another

. . .

<br>

```{.bash}
cat cubane.pdb
```

# `wc`

**W**ord **c**ount: counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file

. . .

<br> `wc -l` : only print line count <br> `wc -w` : only print word count <br> `wc -c` : only print character count

# `*` wildcard

the `*` wildcard expands to all possible matches.

. . .

```{.bash}
wc -l *.pdb
```

# `>` Output Redirection

`>` sends the output of the previous command to a file

. . .

<br>

```{.bash}
wc -l *.pdb > lengths.txt
```

. . .

<br>

::: callout-warning
If you use `>` to send output to an existing file, it will be **overwritten**.

Use `>>` to append to the end of an existing file instead.
:::

# `head` and `tail`

`head` prints the first 10 lines of each file provided to it.

`tail` prints the last 10 lines of each file provided to it.

. . .

<br> `head -n 3`<br> Print the first 3 lines of a file <br>

. . .

<br>

```{.bash}
head -n 6 lengths.txt
```

# `sort`

`sort` the contents of a file alphanumerically.

. . .

<br> `sort -n`<br> Sort numerically

. . .

<br> `sort -nr`<br> Sort numerically in reverse order (descending)

. . .

```{.bash}
sort -nr lengths.txt
```

# `|` Pipe

The pipe `|` allows you to pass the results from one command to the next command.

. . .

You can string together simple commands to create much more powerful actions. <br>

. . .

```{.bash}
cat lengths.txt | head -n 6 | sort -nr
```

# `cut`

Slice and dice your text by position, character, or field.

. . .

<br> `cut -d, -f 1`<br> Retrieve the first column of a comma-delimited (csv) file

. . .

<br> `cut -d" " -f 3`<br> Retrieve the third column of a space-delimited file

. . .

<br>
```{.bash}
head -n 6 lengths.txt | sort -nr | cut -d" " -f 3
```

# `less`

`less` reads in a text-file on page at a time.

`f` : go forward one page<br> `b` : go backward one page<br> `g` : go to beginning<br> `G` : go to end<br> `/` : search forward<br> `?` : search backward<br> `q` : quit less<br>

# `sed`

**s**tream **ed**itor, performs editing on a stream of text, line by line.

. . .

<br> `sed '10,100d'` deletes text in the range lines 10 to 100

. . .

<br>

```{.bash}
cat LittleWomen.txt | sed '20662,21022d' > little-women-no-footer.txt
```

<br>

. . .

```{.bash}
cat little-women-no-footer.txt | sed '1,93d' > little-women-no-footer-header.txt
```

. . .

# Counting 🧟

::: {.callout-tip icon=false} 

## Exercise 

We have been hired to a truly atrocious publisher to adapt and market the public domain book *Little Women* as a zombies remake. They would like us to confirm the word counts of each word in the text to ensure zombies appear frequently enough that they can justify repackaging it as a new book.

Using the text of *Little Women*, use `sed` to replace any instance of `women` with `zombies` to make our new *Little Zombies* text with a minimum of effort. 

Then confirm the word counts of all unique words used in the text.
:::

# `sed` search and replace

We have previously used `sed` (**s**tream **ed**itor), to delete a block of text. This is one of many `sed` functions. We can also use `sed` to search and replace text. For our 🧟 exercise, we are going to replace any occurrence of women with zombies.

<br>

`sed 's/apple/banana/g'` finds all occurrences of the word `apple`, and replaces it with `banana`. The use of `g` means that **ALL** occurrences are replaced. `sed 's/apple/banana/'` would only replace the **first** occurrence.

Use the `sed` search and replace, replace all occurrences of `women` with `zombies` in the file `little-women-no-footer-header.txt` and save it to the file `little-zombies.txt`:

. . . 

<br>
```{.bash}
cat little-women-no-footer-header.txt | sed 's/women/zombies/g' > little-zombies.txt
```

# `<` input redirection

So far we have been using the `>` output redirect to send the results, or output, of a command, or sequence of commands, to a file.  


Some utilities (like `tr`, which we will learn about next) take a stream of text, not a file. This means we need to send a stream of text to them as input using `<`. Using `tr some-file.txt` would fail. In these cases, we use the input redirection (`<`) to send a stream into `tr` like this: `tr < some-file.txt`. We can then save the output to `results.txt` using `tr < some-file.txt > results.txt`. 

. . .

In plain terms:

`command file` passes a file to the command

`command < file` passes the **contents** of the file to command


# `tr`: translate

**tr**anslate or delete characters.

<br>

First, let's use `tr` to translate (match and replace) characters:

. . . 


`tr '[:space:]' '_' < file.txt`<br>
Convert every space to an underscore in `file.txt`

<br>
`tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < file.txt`<br>
Convert all lowercase to uppercase in `file.txt`



## Convert all text in `little-zombies.txt` to lowercase

Using `tr` convert all text to lowercase in the file `little-zombies.txt`. Remember, tr needs a stream, not a file: `tr < file.txt`

. . .

<br>


```{.bash}
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < little-zombies.txt > little-zombies-lower.txt
```


# `tr`

**tr**anslate or delete characters.


Now, we can use `tr` to delete characters using the `-d` flag:

. . . 

<br>
`tr -d '[:space:]_' < file.txt`<br>
Delete every space and underscore in `file.txt`
<br>

<br>
`tr '[:punct:]' < file.txt`<br>
Delete all punctuation in `file.txt`

## Remove all punctuation and new lines in  `little-zombies-lower.txt`

<br>
Use `tr -r` to remove all punctuation and carriage returns (new lines) in `little-zombies-lower.txt`.

<br>
Remember, we can match all punctuation with `[:punct:]` and we can match carriage returns (new line characters) with `\r`. 

. . . 

<br>
```{.bash}
tr -d '[:punct:]\r' < little-zombies-lower.txt > little-zombies-clean.txt 
```

. . . 

<br>
Finally, we need to replace every space with a new line (`\n`) so that each word is on it's own line. This will make it possible to count words that are identical.

```{.bash}
 tr ' ' '\n' < little-zombies-clean.txt > little-zombies-words.txt
```

# `uniq` 

**uniq**ue words

Before we can return word-counts for our cleaned `little-zombies-words.txt` file, we need to learn one more command, `uniq`.

If we have file, `cat-dog.txt` that looks like:

```{.bash}
cat
dog
cat
dog
```
. . . 

<br>
and we ran `cat cat-dog.txt | uniq` we would get the results:

```{.bash}
cat
dog
cat
dog
```


## Combining `uniq` and `sort`

The reason we get

```{.bash}
cat
dog
cat
dog
```
instead of 
cat
dog
```{.bash}
cat
dog
```
is because `uniq` **only** works when repeated words are next to eachother, or sorted!

. . .

<br> 
So by running `cat cat-dog.txt | sort | uniq` we get:

```{.bash}
cat
dog
```

. . .

<br>
and we can add the `-c` flag to get the word count as well!
`cat cat-dog.txt | sort | uniq -c` 

```{.bash}
      2 cat
      2 dog
```

## Get the word-counts for `little-zombies-words.txt`

Using the commands `sort` and `uniq` can you create a file named `zombies-word-count.txt` that has the word counts for each unique word in `little-zombies-words.txt` sorted by word count in descending order (most frequent word on top)?

Give it a try before revealing the solution!


. . .

## Solution

<br>
```{.bash}
cat little-zombies-words.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > zombies-word-count.txt
```

# Back to `cut`

We can combine `tr` and `cut` to solve the problem of a variable number of spaces. 

<br>
In particular, we will use the `tr` flag `tr -s` (squeeze), to collapse multiple spaces down to one.

. . .

<br>
```{.bash}
< lengths.txt tr -s ' ' | head -n 6 | sort -nr | cut -d" " -f 2
```
